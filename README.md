# Perceptron
Perceptron is a supervised machine learning approach using binary classifiers. Here, we try to create an algorithm to create a Perceptron using Gradient Descent approach. Simple logic gate data will be used to test the accuracy of the perceptron. 

Some of the functions and algorithms are adopted from Dr. Hairong Qi's lectures at University of Tennessee.
